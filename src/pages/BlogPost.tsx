          üß† 1. They're Gaining Independence
        </h3>
        
        <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Toddlers are <em>mini control freaks</em>. It's developmentally normal! Saying "no" to sleep is often just a way for them to assert control over their little worlds.
        </p>
        
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-4 mt-6">
          üïí 2. They're Overtired or Under-Tired
        </h3>
        
        <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Yes, both can cause chaos. Overtired kids become wired and hyper. Under-tired kids‚Ä¶ just aren't ready yet. This is where routines (and knowing your kid's sleep needs) come in handy.
        </p>
        
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-4 mt-6">
          üì± 3. Overstimulation Before Bed
        </h3>
        
        <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Screens, sugar, wild play, and light exposure can push their little brains into "party mode" right before bed.

        <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
          Toddlers think you're living your best life while they're stuck in bed. They don't want to miss <em>anything</em>‚Äîeven if it's just you folding laundry and stress-eating pretzels.

        </h2>
        
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-4 mt-6">
          1. Create a Consistent (But Short) Routine
        </h3>
        
        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          The key word here is <em>predictable</em>. Toddlers thrive on structure. A simple 20‚Äì30 minute routine works wonders:
        </p>
        
        <div className="bg-accent p-4 rounded-lg mb-6">
          <p className="leading-relaxed italic">

        </div>
        
        <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Bonus: Use the same phrases every night. "It's time to rest our bodies." "The moon is glowing now." Over time, these become sleep cues.
        </p>
        
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-4 mt-6">
          2. Set Clear Expectations (And Stick To Them)
        </h3>
        
        <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Don't let them drag you into a 45-minute debate over one more book. When you say "last one," mean it. Calm, kind, but firm. Like a gentle drill sergeant in fuzzy slippers.
        </p>
        
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-4 mt-6">
          3. Make the Environment Sleep-Friendly
        </h3>
        
        <ul className="mb-6 leading-relaxed list-disc pl-6">
          <li>Dim lights 30‚Äì60 minutes before bed</li>
          <li>Use blackout curtains (toddlers can detect <em>any</em> stray photon)</li>
          <li>Try white noise to block out barking dogs, creaky floors, or your midnight snack run</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-4 mt-6">
          4. Use a Visual Cue to Reinforce Boundaries
        </h3>
        
        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Here's where <strong>Lumytot</strong> can change the game. Toddlers don't understand time, but they understand light and symbols.
        </p>
        
        <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          With <strong>Lumytot</strong>, the moon icon glows softly during sleep time and switches to a sun when it's okay to wake up or get out of bed. No buttons to push. No overstimulating screens. Just one clear signal that says: <em>Sleep now, play later.</em>
        </p>

          <li>Giving in: You're now sharing a bed with a toddler, three plushies, and 3/4 of a granola bar.</li>

        <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
          It's okay. We've all been there. The key is consistency, not perfection.

          üî¨ What's the Deal With Red Light?
        </h2>

          Short answer: It's the only light that doesn't mess with your sleep hormones.
        </p>
        
        <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
          Longer (but still parent-friendly) answer: Light affects our circadian rhythms‚Äîthose internal clocks that tell our bodies when to sleep and wake. Blue and white light, which is what you find in most overhead lights and screens, <strong>suppress melatonin</strong> (the hormone that helps you fall and stay asleep). Red light, on the other hand? ‚ú® <strong>Melatonin-friendly. Brain-calming. Toddler-whispering magic.</strong>

          Let's get one thing straight: your child is <em>not</em> doing this to ruin your life (even if it really feels like it when you're blinking at the coffee machine in total darkness). Early waking is incredibly common in babies and toddlers‚Äîand thankfully, there are ways to fix it.

        </h3>
        
        <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          This sounds backwards, but both can cause early waking. Too-early bedtimes can leave them fully rested before 6AM. Too-late bedtimes can lead to overtiredness, which messes with sleep quality and causes‚Ä¶ you guessed it: early wakes.

          Lumytot is a simple glowing clock that visually shows your toddler when it's time to sleep and when it's okay to wake. It uses calming, soft light (not the eye-burning kind) and has <strong>no buttons to mash or animations to distract</strong>.
        </p>
        
        <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          When the moon is glowing, it's still sleep time. When the sun comes on, they know it's time to get up. Over a few days, kids start to <em>get it</em>‚Äîand mornings magically get quieter.

          üß∏ 4. Keep Early Mornings Boring
        </h3>
        
        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          This one is key: <em>Don't accidentally reward early waking.</em>
        </p>
        
        <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          If your toddler wakes early and gets cuddles, snacks, or iPad time‚Ä¶ guess what? They're going to keep doing it. Keep it boring. Calm. Lights dim. Minimal talking. No showbiz.
        </p>
        
        <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
          They'll eventually learn that early waking isn't worth the effort.

          <li>Don't let them nap wherever, whenever‚Äîconsistency is your new religion.</li>
          <li>Don't say "Just this once" (you'll say it 14 times).</li>
          <li>Don't scream into a pillow at 5:01AM. (Okay, fine, maybe once.)</li>

        </h2>
        
        <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          The truth is, toddlers are learning <em>everything</em>. Including how to sleep well. It's not about punishment or control‚Äîit's about creating clear signals, safety, and routine.
        </p>
        
        <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
          That's exactly why <strong>Lumytot</strong> was born. (Fun fact: Our founder's toddler once woke up at 4:48AM for a full week. We don't talk about that week.)

          <li>Toddler waking at 5AM? Super common.</li>
